   * ```
   * applyBatchForUid(nextUid, patch)
   * onSelectUid(nextUid)
   * ```
   *
   * Why this exists: a plain uid switch triggers the hook's uid-change
   * effect, which asynchronously loads `forUid`'s *persisted* filters and
   * overwrites state once the load resolves. If the modal had already
   * written `patch` (e.g. via `applyBatch`) before switching, that write
   * targets the keyboard being left, and the incoming load for `forUid`
   * would then clobber the just-applied values with whatever was last
   * saved for `forUid` — the two writers race and the modal's Apply loses.
   *
   * The uid-change effect performs the persisted load for `forUid` as
   * normal, then merges the registered patch ON TOP of the loaded filters
   * in the same resolution (patch wins only for the fields it contains).
   * Fields the patch doesn't touch (tab-specific view settings like
   * `heatmap` / `wpm` / ...) therefore keep the DESTINATION keyboard's
   * persisted values — the patch must never clobber settings the user
   * saved on the keyboard being switched to. The race the mechanism
   * exists for stays solved because the merge happens atop the load
   * inside the same effect: the load result can never land *after* the
   * patch and overwrite it. The merged result is then scheduled for save
   * exactly like a normal edit, so it persists to `forUid`'s file.
   *
   * A registration is single-shot and keyed to `forUid`: if the uid that
   * actually lands doesn't match (the caller changed its mind, or never
   * followed up with `onSelectUid`), the pending entry is discarded on the
   * next uid change rather than silently applying to the wrong keyboard.
   *
   * Calling this with the *current* uid delegates straight to `applyBatch`
   * (there is no uid-change effect coming to consume a registration), so
   * the API is a strict superset of `applyBatch` and safe to call without
   * knowing whether the uid is actually changing. */
