// The footer's Keyboard Layout select never opens this modal itself
// anymore — `handleKeyboardLayoutChange` is a plain display switch for
// EVERY value, including QWERTY (no more per-value branching). Selecting a
// pack that supports a rewrite instead surfaces `KeymapEditor`'s
// simulation/Base tabs (gated by `useDevicePrefs.remapKind ===
// 'simulated'`, the SAME `keymapApplicable && buildKeymapRewriteTable(map)
// .ok` predicate this hook re-derives below) — the Apply button living on
// the simulation tab's layer row is what calls `requestApply()`, the only
// entry point left into this modal.
//
// A Rewrite is still a destructive one-shot: undo/redo history is wiped
// the moment any write lands, and recovery is the user's own .vil/snapshot
// backup (the modal recommends saving first), not Undo. On a clean success
// the select resets to QWERTY, the same clean state a snapshot/.vil
// restore leaves — which also makes the simulation tabs disappear, since
// `remapKind` reverts to 'actual' for QWERTY.
