## 1. Device Connection

### 1.1 Device Selection Screen

When you launch the app, a list of connected Vial-compatible keyboards is displayed.

![Device Selection Screen](screenshots/01-device-selection.png)

- USB-connected keyboards are automatically detected
- If multiple keyboards are connected, select one from the list
- On Linux, udev rules may need to be configured if no devices are found

### 1.2 Connecting a Keyboard

Click a keyboard name in the list to open the keymap editor. A connecting overlay shows loading progress while the keyboard data is read.

If Cloud Sync is configured, sync progress is also displayed during connection (favorites first, then keyboard-specific data).

### 1.3 Data Modal

The Data button on the device selection screen opens the Data modal for centralized management of favorites and Hub posts.

![Data Modal — Favorites](screenshots/02-data-modal.png)

- **Favorites tabs**: Tap Dance, Macro, Combo, Key Override, Alt Repeat Key — each type has its own tab
- Per-entry actions: click to rename, delete, or **Export** individual entries
- **Hub actions**: When Hub is connected, each entry shows **Upload to Hub** / **Update on Hub** / **Remove from Hub** buttons (same as the inline favorites panel)
- **Import** / **Export All** buttons at the footer for bulk operations

![Data Modal — Hub Posts](screenshots/02-data-modal-hub-posts.png)

- **Hub Posts** tab: Manage your Pipette Hub uploads (visible when Hub is connected)

## 2. Keymap Editor

### 2.1 Screen Layout

The keymap editor consists of two main areas: the keyboard layout display and the keycode palette.

![Keymap Editor Overview](screenshots/03-keymap-editor-overview.png)

- Top area: Physical keyboard layout (shows the current keycode assigned to each key)
- Left side: Toolbar (dual mode, zoom, etc.)
- Bottom area: Keycode palette (tabbed interface) with overlay panel toggle
- Right side (when open): Keycodes Overlay Panel (tools, save, layout options)
- Bottom bar: Status bar

### 2.2 Changing Keys

1. Click a key on the keyboard layout to select it
2. Click a keycode from the keycode palette to assign it
3. The key display updates immediately
4. Changes are automatically sent to the keyboard

- Ctrl+click to select multiple keys
- Shift+click for range selection

### 2.3 Layer Switching

Layer switching buttons are located on the left side of the keyboard layout.

![Layer 0](screenshots/04-layer-0.png)

![Layer 1](screenshots/05-layer-1.png)

![Layer 2](screenshots/06-layer-2.png)

- Click layer number buttons to switch between layers
- Layer 0 is the default layer
- The number of available layers depends on the keyboard configuration

The layer panel can be collapsed to save space:

![Layer Panel Collapsed](screenshots/39-layer-panel-collapsed.png)

Click the collapse button (chevron) to minimize the layer panel to just numbers. Click the expand button to restore full layer names.

![Layer Panel Expanded](screenshots/40-layer-panel-expanded.png)

### 2.4 Key Popover

Double-click a key on the keyboard layout to open the Key Popover — a quick way to search and assign keycodes without scrolling through the palette.

**Key Tab**

![Key Popover — Key Tab](screenshots/32-key-popover-key.png)

- The search input is pre-filled with the current keycode name
- Type to search by name, QMK ID, or alias — results are ranked by relevance
- Click a result to assign it immediately
- The popover also appears when double-clicking key fields in detail editors (Tap Dance, Combo, Key Override, etc.)

**Code Tab**

![Key Popover — Code Tab](screenshots/33-key-popover-code.png)

- Enter a keycode value directly in hexadecimal (e.g., `0x0029` for Escape)
- The resolved keycode name is displayed below the hex input
- Click **Apply** to assign the entered keycode

**Wrapper Modes**

The mode buttons at the top of the popover let you build composite keycodes:

![Key Popover — Modifier Mode](screenshots/34-key-popover-modifier.png)

- **Mod Mask**: Combine a modifier with a key (e.g., `LSFT(KC_ESCAPE)`)
- **Mod-Tap**: Modifier on hold, key on tap (e.g., `LSFT_T(KC_ESCAPE)`)

Both modes show the modifier checkbox strip to select Left/Right Ctrl, Shift, Alt, or GUI. Left and Right modifiers cannot be mixed — selecting one side disables the other.

![Key Popover — LT Mode](screenshots/35-key-popover-lt.png)

- **LT**: Layer-Tap — activate a layer on hold, send a key on tap (e.g., `LT0(KC_ESCAPE)`). A layer selector appears to choose the target layer.
- **SH_T**: Swap Hands Tap — swap hands on hold, send a key on tap (e.g., `SH_T(KC_ESCAPE)`)
- **LM**: Layer-Mod — activate a layer with modifiers (e.g., `LM(0, MOD_LSFT)`). Shows both the layer selector and the modifier checkbox strip.

Click an active mode button to toggle it off and revert to a basic keycode.

Press Escape or click outside the popover to close it.

### 2.5 Layout Options

Some keyboards support multiple physical layouts (e.g., split backspace, ISO enter, different bottom row configurations). When a keyboard has layout options, a Layout Options button (grid icon) appears at the right end of the keycode palette tab bar.

![Layout Options Panel](screenshots/layout-options-open.png)

- Click the grid icon to open the Layout Options panel
- **Checkbox options**: Toggle a layout variant on or off (e.g., "Macro Pad", "Split Backspace", "ISO Enter")
- **Dropdown options**: Select from multiple layout variants (e.g., "Bottom Section" with Full Grid / Macro Pad / Arrow Keys choices)
- Changes are applied immediately — the keyboard layout display updates in real time to reflect the selected options

![Layout Options Changed](screenshots/layout-options-changed.png)

- Selecting a different option updates the visible keys on the keyboard layout
- Layout options are saved to the keyboard and persist across sessions
- Click outside the panel or press Escape to close it

> **Note**: The Layout Options button only appears for keyboards that define multiple layout variants. Most keyboards with a single fixed layout do not show this button. Screenshots in this section were taken using a dummy JSON definition loaded via "Load from JSON file".

## 6. Editor Settings Panel

Open the editor settings panel from the save button (floppy disk icon) in the keycode tab bar, or use the Save tab in the Keycodes Overlay Panel (§3.10).

### 6.1 Cloud Sync (Google Drive appDataFolder)

Pipette can sync your saved snapshots, favorites, and per-keyboard settings across multiple devices via Google Drive.

Sync is configured in the **Settings** modal (gear icon on the device selection screen), under the **Data** tab:

- If a password already exists on the server (set from another device), a hint is shown asking you to enter the same password
- **Change Password**: Click **Change Password** to re-encrypt all synced files with a new password. No data is deleted — existing files are decrypted and re-encrypted in place

#### Sync Controls

#### Data Storage

Synced data is stored in [Google Drive appDataFolder](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/appdata) — a hidden, app-specific folder that only Pipette can access. Your personal Drive files are never touched.

See the [Data Guide](Data.md) for details on what is synced and how your data is protected.

#### Settings — Troubleshooting

![Settings — Troubleshooting](screenshots/settings-troubleshooting.png)

The Troubleshooting tab in the Settings modal (on the device selection screen) provides:
